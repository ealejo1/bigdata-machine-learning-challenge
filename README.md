# Machine Learning using Spotify API

Spotify has python library called 'Spotipy' where we can use to extract songs/tracks, albums, playlist, artist, etc. in Spotify API.
</br>

## Idea Overview

Using user interaction, we will ask a few questions to the user to receive their interests on what kind of songs they want to listen to. From the data we extracted from Spotify API, we train the model using machine learning and model will then predict the songs and give song recommendation to the user that he/she might be interested in.

<b> Steps: </b>
1. Extract Songs/Tracks Data from Spotify API (Spotipy) by Genres
2. Clean The Collected Data and Consolidate All Different Genres CSVs into One CSV
3. Create A Training and Testing Machine Learning Model and Decide The Best Model with Highest Accuracy
4. Build Flask App and Website for User Interaction
